# ME 405 Lab 2 Repository

### Contents
##### Our team ran step responses of the motor testing 3 different proportional
##### gain values to analyze its effect on the system. The lowest gain tested 
##### was a Kp of 0.01, which was too low as can be seen in the first plot. 
##### Although the accuracy is similar to the other responses and there is no
##### overshoot, the rise time is slower than that of larger gains. The next 
##### image shows the response from a gain of 0.1, and we can see that there is
##### some small overshoot and oscillation but with a slightly faqster rise time.
##### The last image is the step response of the motor with a gain of 0.4. We
##### can see that the extended oscillations delay the settling time of the system
##### with no added benefit of any significant increase in accuracy, making this
##### value of Kp less than optimal.
